                    This project focuses on developing an intelligent, real-time library seat management 
                    and reservation system, leveraging modern web technologies and IoT integration. The 
                    system offers users a streamlined interface for booking seats through a web application, 
                    enabling them to select and reserve available desks for specified time periods. 
                    Real-time seat status monitoring ensures users can view current occupancy, managed 
                    through IoT-enabled indicators that reflect desk availability. The system enforces 
                    comprehensive validation checks, such as date and time restrictions, to prevent double 
                    bookings and manage usage within operational hours. Additionally, booking data is 
                    synchronized with the server to facilitate live updates and automated seat tracking, 
                    significantly reducing the manual workload on library staff. User notifications and a 
                    history feature enhance the user experience, providing confirmations and usage analytics. 
                    This innovative approach aims to optimize resource management, improve user satisfaction, 
                    and modernize library operations through technology-driven solutions.
